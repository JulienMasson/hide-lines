;;; Commentary
;; 
;; The simplest way to make hide-lines work is to add the following
;; lines to your .emacs file:
;; 
;; (autoload 'hide-lines "hide-lines" "Hide lines based on a regexp" t)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c /") 'hide-lines)
;; 
;; Now, when you type C-c /, you will be prompted for a regexp
;; (regular expression).  All lines matching this regexp will be
;; hidden in the buffer.
;; 
;; Alternatively, you can type C-u C-c / (ie. provide a prefix
;; argument to the hide-lines command) to hide all lines that *do not*
;; match the specified regexp. If you want to reveal previously hidden
;; lines you can use any other prefix, e.g. C-u C-u C-c /
;; 

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `hide-lines'
;;    Call `hide-lines-matching'. With a prefix arg of 4 (C-u) call `hide-lines-not-matching'.
;;    With any other prefix call `hide-lines-show-all'.
;;  `hide-lines-not-matching'
;;    Hide lines that don't match the specified regexp.
;;  `hide-lines-matching'
;;    Hide lines matching the specified regexp.
;;  `hide-lines-show-all'
;;    Show all areas hidden by the filter-buffer command
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put hide-lines.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'hide-lines)

;;; Change log:
;;	
;; 2013/06/22 - Add namespace prefixes to functions and variables.
;;              Add licence and add to Marmalade repo.
;;              Alter hide-lines so that it can also show all lines
;; 
;; 24/03/2004 - Incorporate fix for infinite loop bug from David Hansen.
